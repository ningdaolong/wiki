In Kotlin, there's no way to check the generic parameters at runtime in general case (like just checking the items of a List<T>, which is only a special case), so casting a generic type to another with different generic parameters will raise a warning unless the cast lies within variance bounds.

There are different solutions, however:

* You have checked the type and you are quite sure that the cast is safe. Given that, you can suppress the warning with @Suppress("UNCHECKED_CAST").

@Suppress("UNCHECKED_CAST")
val waypointList = list as? List<Waypoint> ?: return null
* Use .filterIsInstance<T>() function, which checks the item types and returns a list with the items of the passed type:

val waypointList: List<Waypoint> = list.filterIsInstance<Waypoint>()

if (waypointList.size != list.size)
    return null
or the same in one statement:

val waypointList = list.filterIsInstance<Waypoint>()
    .apply { if (size != list.size) return null }
This will create a new list of the desired type (thus avoiding unchecked cast inside), introducing a little overhead, but in the same time it saves you from iterating through the list and checking the types (in list.foreach { ... } line), so it won't be noticeable.

* Write a utility function that checks the type and returns the same list if the type is correct, thus encapsulating the cast (still unchecked from the compiler's point of view) inside it:

@Suppress("UNCHECKED_CAST")
inline fun <reified T : Any> List<*>.checkItemsAre() =
        if (all { it is T })
            this as List<T>
        else null
With the usage:

val waypointList = list.checkItemsAre<Waypoint>() ?: return null
